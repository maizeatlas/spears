# SPEARS
Standard Performance Evaluation of Ancestral Reconstruction through Simulation

# Credits
SPEARS was developed and coded by Heather Manching under the guidance of Dr. Randall J. Wisser. This work was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Grant Nos. 2011-67003-30342 and 2018-67011-28052 from the USDA-NIFA. We thank Dr. Chaozhi Zheng for support in operating RABBIT.

# Overview
Here we introduce SPEARS, a pipeline for simulation-based performance appraisal of ancestral haplotype inference. SPEARS determines the reliablability of inferred ancestral haplotype maps. It can be used to assess the performance of a new method or tool and to examine expectations for conceived or existing popultion designs. 

Simulations are used to generate genome-wide haplotype maps for many individuals. This truth data is retained but also modified (in the pipeline) to mimic sparse genotype data that enters the standard multi-step process of imputation and haplotype reconstruction. Comparing the expected data to the inferred data allows the results to be benchmarked.

We developed SPEARS to allow for start-to-finish analysis of a given population through simulation with SAEGUS, imputation with MaCH, and ancestral haplotype reconstruction with RABBIT. Performance appraisal is based on four metrics of accuracy: ancestral assignment accuracy, genotype assignment accuracy, switch-error rate (haplotype phasing) and the correlation in crossover counts.

## Description and user requirements for each script

We have provided parent data (founder_key.txt) that can be used for running through the pipeline. These scripts need to be run in order.

1. **1_SAEGUS.py**

This script is specific for the test population described in the manuscript. It takes user supplied genetic map data and pedigree information and generates data for 1000 random individuals from the last generation in the pedigree. It follows the tutorial for SAEGUS available on github. **It needs to be customized based on user's population.**

* **Required Input Files**
  * Founder Key Data (example: founder_key.txt): Tab-delimited text documented formatted with the following headers in this order: **snpID, chr, POS, cM, F_MISS, founder1, founder2, founder3, ... , foundern**
   * Header Descriptions
     * **snpID**: numerical assignment to each marker (ordered by chr and POS) can skip numbers, but should be consecutive numbers based on chr and POS
     * **chr**: numeric assignment to the chromosome for each marker
     * **POS**: physical position of each marker (in bp)
     * **cM**: cM for each marker
     * **F_MISS**: A number between 0 and 1 that corresponds to the proportion of individuals at a given marker with missing data (1 is completely missing, 0 is all individuals have genotype data)
     * **founder1 ... foundern**: columns corresponding to the founders/parents of the population. Column names can be any character name (founder1, parent1, CML10, etc...), but must be in order that was used for numerical assignmnet in the simulation (founder1, founder2, founder3 must correspond to 0,1,2 in population). Values in each column are bi-allelic genotype data in the format allele1/allele2 (example: A/A, G/A, T/C). 
  

2. **2_SAEGUS_to_MACH_format.R**

Takes output from 1_SAEGUS.py (formatted as described above) and reformats for use in MaCH. Creates a subfolder in the working directory called MaCH and within this subfolder creates a folder for each chromosome. In each chromosome folder, it creates 4 input files that are used by MaCH for imputation: 1) founders_chrom_n.haplos, 2) founders_chrom_n.snps, 3) simdata_chrom_n.dat, 4) simdata_chrom_n.PED.

* **Required Input Files**
  * Simulated output (from 1_SAEGUS.py) (example: simuPOP_n1000.csv)
    * Formatted with headers: **sex, aff, marker1_a1, marker1_a2 ... markern_a2**. Column names for each marker/allele formatted as any character name as long as each marker is in order based on chromosome and position and each allele for each marker are next to each other (example: marker1_a1, marker1_a2, marker2_a1, marker2_a2 would be appropriate headers). Values for sex and aff columns are not relevant for SPEARS (columns serve as placeholders and are default output from 1_SAEGUS.py).
  * Founder Key Data (example: founder_key.txt): see description in 1_SAEGUS.py.

3. **3_MACH_sample_run_script.sh**

Takes output from 2_SAEGUS_to_MaCH_format.R and performs imputation using MaCH. This is a two-step process (step1: estimate model parameters, step2: perform imputation). See MaCH tutorial for details on user requirements. This script runs 1000 iterations (-r 1000). **Needs to be modified and run for each chromosome.**

* **Required Input Files**
  * Output from 2_SAEGUS_to_MACH_format.R 
    * founders_chrom_n.haplos: founder haplotypes for each chromosome n. 
    * founders_chrom_n.snps: snps that are present in the founder data for each chromosome n. 
    * simdata_chrom_n.dat: snps that are present in the population that overlap with the founder snps for each chromosome n. 
    * simdata_chrom_n.PED: genotypes for each sample for the snps listed in simdata_chrom_n.dat. 

4. **4_MACH_to_RABBIT_format.R**
