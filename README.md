# SPEARS
Standard Performance Evaluation of Ancestral Reconstruction through Simulation

# Credits
SPEARS was developed and coded by Heather Manching under the guidance of Dr. Randall J. Wisser. This work was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Grant Nos. 2011-67003-30342 and 2018-67011-28052 from the USDA-NIFA. We thank Dr. Chaozhi Zheng for support in operating RABBIT.

# Overview
Here we introduce SPEARS, a pipeline for simulation-based performance appraisal of ancestral haplotype inference. SPEARS determines the reliablability of inferred ancestral haplotype maps. It can be used to assess the performance of a new method or tool and to examine expectations for conceived or existing population designs. 

Simulations are used to generate genome-wide haplotype maps for many individuals. This truth data is retained but also modified (in the pipeline) to mimic sparse genotype data that enters the standard multi-step process of imputation and haplotype reconstruction. Comparing the expected data to the inferred data allows the results to be benchmarked.

We developed SPEARS to allow for start-to-finish analysis of a given population through simulation with SAEGUS, imputation with MaCH, and ancestral haplotype reconstruction with RABBIT. Performance appraisal is based on four metrics of accuracy: ancestral assignment accuracy, genotype assignment accuracy, switch-error rate (haplotype phasing) and the correlation in crossover counts.

## Description and user requirements for each script

We have provided parent test data with 10,000 markers (test_founder_key_vcf.txt) that can be used for running through the pipeline quickly. We have also included a parent data set with 47,078 markers (used for manuscript, founder_key_vcf.txt), although this takes longer to run. These scripts need to be run in order.

1. **1_SAEGUS_multiparent.py**

This script is specific for the multiparent population described in the manuscript. It takes a user supplied genetic map and pedigree information and generates genotype and parent-of-origin data for 1000 random individuals from the last generation in the pedigree. It follows the tutorial for SAEGUS available on github. Output includes two files: 1) simdata_n1000_test_set_GTform_vcf.csv (this include genotypes for all sampled progeny in the format: "0/0","0/1","1/0","1/1" and is required input for 2_SAEGUS_to_MACH_format.R) and 2) simdata_n1000_parent_of_origin.csv (origin of each allele for each marker in each individual and is required inputfor 7_Calculate_OVD_AAA_GAA_SER_CCC.R). **It needs to be customized based on user's population.**

* **Required Input Files**
  * Founder Key Data (example: founder_key_vcf.txt): Tab-delimited text document formatted with the following headers in this order: **snpID, chr, POS, cM, F_MISS, REF, ALT, founder1, founder2, founder3, ... , foundern**
   * Header Descriptions
     * **snpID**: numerical assignment to each marker (ordered by chr and POS) can skip numbers, but should be consecutive numbers based on chr and POS
     * **chr**: numeric assignment to the chromosome for each marker
     * **POS**: physical position of each marker (in bp)
     * **cM**: cM for each marker
     * **REF**: Reference allele for each marker
     * **ALT**: Alternate allele for each marker
     * **F_MISS**: A number between 0 and 1 that corresponds to the proportion of progeny at a given marker with missing data (1 is completely missing, 0 is all individuals have genotype data)
     * **founder1 ... foundern**: columns corresponding to the founders/parents of the population. Column names can be any character name (founder1, parent1, CML10, etc...). Genotypes in each founder column are bi-allelic vcf format and must be homozygous (0/0 or 1/1).
  

2. **2_SAEGUS_to_MACH_format.R**

Takes output from 1_SAEGUS.py (formatted as described above) and reformats for use in MaCH. User defines all parameters in this script as follows: wd (working directory), sd (name of GT output from SAEGUS), ld (name of parent-of-origin output from SAEGUS), fd (name of founder data key), chrom (total number of chromosomes), popID (ID assigned to population for MACH input), sn (total number of progeny), rsq (R-square threshold for MACH output), and g_error (global genotyping error). These parameter are outputted in a file (user_input.txt) that will be referenced in all downstream scripts. It also outputs known GT data (reformatted from SAEGUS output, known_GT_simdata_vcf.csv, required input for 7_Calculate_OVD_AAA_GAA_SER_CCC.R). Creates a subfolder in the working directory called MaCH and within this subfolder creates a folder for each chromosome. In each chromosome folder, it creates the 4 input files required by MaCH for imputation: 1) founders_chrom_n.haplos, 2) founders_chrom_n.snps, 3) simdata_chrom_n.dat, 4) simdata_chrom_n.PED.

* **Required Input Files**
  * Simulated GT output (from 1_SAEGUS_multiparent.py) (example: simdata_n1000_test_set_GTform_vcf.csv)
    * Formatted with headers: **ind_id, markers as: 1_1 (snpID 1, allele 1), 1_2 (snpID 2, allele 2) ... n_1, n_2 (for n number of markers)**. Column names for each marker/allele can be formatted as any character name as long as each marker is in order based on chromosome and position and each allele for each marker are next to each other (example: marker1_a1, marker1_a2, marker2_a1, marker2_a2 would also be appropriate headers).
  * Founder Key Data (example: founder_key.txt): see description in 1_SAEGUS.py.

3. **3_MACH_sample_run_script.sh**
